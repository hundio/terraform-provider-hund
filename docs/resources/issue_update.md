# hund_issue_update (Resource)

Issue Updates describe a particular phase in the evolution of an issue. Updates have their own bodies and label, and can also change the current state override of the Issue. Updates are also responsible for resolving/reopening Issues, as well as adding addendums/postmortems to the end of an Issue.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "hund_issue" "example" {
  archive_on_destroy = true

  title = "a terraform issue"
  body_translations = {
    en       = "**lol** ok.\nnah"
    de       = "**lul** ok.\nnein"
    original = "en"
  }
  component_ids = ["5d72d51f8fbb65b5d3a587e1"]
  began_at      = "2023-09-23T13:00:00Z"
}

resource "hund_issue_update" "example0" {
  archive_on_destroy = true

  issue_id        = resource.hund_issue.example.id
  effective_after = timeadd(resource.hund_issue.example.began_at, "2h")
  body            = "heads up"
}

resource "hund_issue_update" "example1" {
  archive_on_destroy = true

  depends_on = [hund_issue_update.example0]

  issue_id = resource.hund_issue.example.id
  body     = "keeping watch (shh)"
  label    = "monitoring"
}

resource "hund_issue_update" "example2" {
  archive_on_destroy = true

  depends_on = [hund_issue_update.example1]

  issue_id = resource.hund_issue.example.id
  label    = "resolved"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `issue_id` (String) The Issue that this Update pertains to.

### Optional

- `archive_on_destroy` (Boolean) When true, this Update will not be destroyed from your status page if the resource is destroyed in your Terraform configuration. This option is **recommended** for maintaining a history on your status page of past Issues.
- `body` (String) The body text of this Update in raw markdown, in the default translation.
- `body_translations` (Map of String) The body text of this Update in raw markdown, translated into multiple languages. Map keys express the language each string value is to be interpreted in. The `original` field of this map denotes the language used for the non-`_translations` version of this attribute.
- `effective_after` (String) The time after which this Update is considered the latest Update on its Issue, until the `effective_after` time of the Update succeeding this one, if one exists.
- `label` (String) The label applied to this update, as well as the issue at large when this Update is the *latest* Update in the Issue. The label can be thought of as the "state" of the Issue as of this Update (e.g. "Problem Identified", "Monitoring", "Resolved").
- `state_override` (Number) The integer state which overrides the state of affected Components in `component`. A value of `null` indicates no override is present.
- `template` (Attributes) An application of an IssueTemplate, which contains a copy of the template fields of the associated IssueTemplate, as well as an object of user-defined variables that parameterize the template. 

-> Alterations to this field do not affect the associated `issue_template_id`, and will update the Issue/Update's content accordingly. Conversely, modification/deletion of the associated IssueTemplate do not affect the attributes of this field. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--template))

### Read-Only

- `body_html` (String) An HTML rendered view of the markdown in `body`, in the default translation.
- `body_html_translations` (Map of String) An HTML rendered view of the markdown in `body`, translated into multiple languages. Map keys express the language each string value is to be interpreted in. The `original` field of this map denotes the language used for the non-`_translations` version of this attribute.
- `created_at` (String) The timestamp at which this Update was created.
- `effective` (Boolean) When true, denotes that this Update is the latest update on this Issue (hence, the "effective" Update according to `effective_after`).
- `id` (String) The ObjectId of this Update.
- `reopening` (Boolean) Whether this Update reopened the Issue if it was already resolved in an Update before this one.
- `updated_at` (String) The timestamp at which this Update was last updated.

### Nested Schema for `template`

Required:

- `issue_template_id` (String) The ObjectId of an IssueTemplate to use as the basis of this Application, which will inform the values for `body`, `label`, and `title` (when `kind = "issue"`). If this value is changed, then the application will be re-created according to the values of the given IssueTemplate.

Optional:

- `body` (String) The [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) template for the `body` of the applied Issue/Update, in the default translation.
- `body_translations` (Map of String) The [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) template for the `body` of the applied Issue/Update, translated into multiple languages. Map keys express the language each string value is to be interpreted in. The `original` field of this map denotes the language used for the non-`_translations` version of this attribute.
- `label` (String) The template for the `label` of the applied Issue/Update.
- `schema` (Attributes Map) An object defining a set of typed variables that can be provided in `variables`. The variables can be accessed from any field in the IssueTemplate supporting Liquid.

-> This field is normally copied from the underlying `issue_template`, but can be overridden here as necessary. In any case, `variables` must adhere to `schema`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--template--schema))
- `variables` (Attributes Map) An object of variable assignments used to parameterize the associated IssueTemplate. If the associated IssueTemplate marks a variable as `required`, then it must appear here with an appropriate value. The type of each variable must match the type set in the template's schema. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--template--variables))

Read-Only:

- `id` (String) The ObjectId of this IssueTemplateApplication.

<a id="nestedatt--template--schema"></a>
### Nested Schema for `template.schema`

Optional:

- `required` (Boolean) Whether this variable is required when applying the template to an Issue/Update.
- `type` (String) The expected type of this variable. One of `datetime`, `i18n-string`, `number`, or `string`.


<a id="nestedatt--template--variables"></a>
### Nested Schema for `template.variables`

Optional:

- `datetime` (String)
- `i18n_string` (Map of String)
- `number` (Number)
- `string` (String)
