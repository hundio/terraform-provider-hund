<a id="nestedatt--watchdog--service--dns"></a>
### Nested Schema for `watchdog.service.dns`

Required:

- `record_type` (String) The type of DNS record to query for on the target.
- `regions` (Set of String) The regions you would like the target to be checked from. All regions are
weighted equally when calculating the outcome of a check. Currently, a single
check can use up to 8 regions simultaneously. Using at least two regions for a
single check is recommended in order to confirm failures across regions.

-> Each check may use up to **three** regions at no extra cost. Each region added to this check beyond the base three will incur an additional cost. For specific pricing information, please visit the [pricing](https://hund.io/pricing) page.
- `target` (String) The domain/IP address that will be queried. IP addresses do not need to be
converted to the `z.y.x.w.in-addr.arpa` format, as this will be done
automatically; however, both formats are accepted.

Optional:

- `consecutive_check_degraded_threshold` (Number) The number of consecutive failed checks required before posting a "degraded"
status.

  Note that regardless of threshold settings, a component will post "operational"
whenever a check succeeds, thus resetting the consecutive check failure count.

  When `null`, denotes that this check will not use a "degraded" stage
when encountering check failures.

  When 0, denotes that this check will post "degraded" upon the first check failure.
- `consecutive_check_outage_threshold` (Number) The number of consecutive failed checks required before posting an "outage"
status. If `consecutive_check_degraded_threshold` is non-null, then the outage
will only be posted after degraded has posted according to its own threshold.

  Note that regardless of threshold settings, a component will post "operational"
whenever a check succeeds, thus resetting the consecutive check failure count.

  When 0, denotes that this check will post "outage" upon the first check failure
(or the first check failure after "degraded" has been posted in case
`consecutive_check_degraded_threshold` is set).
- `frequency` (Number) The frequency of the check in milliseconds. The maximum frequency is every 30
seconds.

-> Any frequency greater than every 60 seconds will force the component
to become High-Frequency, at an additional cost. For specific pricing
information, please visit the [pricing](https://hund.io/pricing) page.
- `nameservers` (List of String) An optional list of nameservers to make DNS queries with. This field is
ignored by SOA queries since they use the nameservers yielded by querying NS
on the target.
- `percentage_regions_failed_threshold` (Number) The percentage of regions that must report a failed check before the entire
check can be considered failed. Requiring at least two regions for this
threshold is recommended in order to confirm failures across regions.
- `response_containment` (String) Whether `all` of the assertions in `responses_must_contain` must match the DNS response,
or rather just `any` of them (i.e. at least one).
- `responses_must_contain` (Set of String) A set of assertions to make against the records yielded by the query. The
format of these assertions is *similar* to DNS record syntax, but is
slightly simplified and allows for only asserting parts of a record's RDATA,
rather than the entire thing. The check will fail depending on the value of
`response_containment`.

  This field is ignored by the SOA check, as it does not use assertions to
determine the validity of SOA records. Instead, we ensure that every
nameserver reported by querying NS on the target reports the same SOA serial.
If your target's nameservers report conflicting SOA serials, we consider the
check failed.

  **Example Assertions (for MX record type):**
```json
[
  "10 mail.example.com",
  "spool.example.com",
  "mail2.example.com"
]
```

  Note above how we can assert both the priority and domain (*without* the
terminating period required by canonical DNS) of an MX record, or instead
simply the domain.
- `timeout` (Number) The maximum number of milliseconds the check should wait on the host before
failing.

  Note that regardless of threshold settings, a component will post "operational"
whenever a check succeeds, thus resetting the consecutive check failure count.

(or the first check failure after "degraded" has been posted in case
`consecutive_check_degraded_threshold` is set).

`response_body_must_contain_mode`):

the check will fail. [Click here](https://hund.io/help/documentation/regular-expressions) for
more information on the use and supported syntax of Hund regexes.

[Click here](https://hund.io/help/documentation/regular-expressions) for more information on
the use and supported syntax of Hund regexes.

  If you send data and expect the target to reply, you must populate this field.
Leaving this field blank will prevent the check from receiving data from the
target unless forced to wait for an initial response.

  The "response" from the target that this text is asserted against will be the
response from the target *after* sending data. If data is not sent to the
target, this text is asserted against the *initial* response.
- `response_must_contain_mode` (String) The response containment mode; either `exact` or `regex`. The modes are discussed

when encountering check failures.

  When 0, denotes that this check will post "degraded" upon the first check failure.
- `consecutive_check_outage_threshold` (Number) The number of consecutive failed checks required before posting an "outage"

will only be posted after degraded has posted according to its own threshold.

<a id="nestedatt--watchdog--service--updown"></a>
### Nested Schema for `watchdog.service.updown`

Required:

- `monitor_api_key` (String, Sensitive) An Updown.io monitor API key. This API key can be read-only.
- `monitor_token` (String) An Updown.io monitor token to retrieve status from.


<a id="nestedatt--watchdog--service--uptimerobot"></a>
### Nested Schema for `watchdog.service.uptimerobot`

Required:

- `monitor_api_key` (String, Sensitive) An Uptime Robot monitor API key to retrieve status from.

Optional:

- `unconfirmed_is_down` (Boolean) When true, triggers Watchdog outage when UptimeRobot reports a yet unconfirmed outage.


<a id="nestedatt--watchdog--service--webhook"></a>
### Nested Schema for `watchdog.service.webhook`

Optional:

- `consecutive_checks` (Number) This property is only required when `deadman: true`. This property configures how many checks (i.e. the number of times `reporting_interval` elapses) must fail (i.e. no status reported to the webhook) before triggering the "Dead Man's Switch." For example, if `deadman: true` and `reporting_interval: 60`, then a setting of `consecutive_checks: 5` would cause the Watchdog to wait for 5 consecutive minutes to receive a webhook call before triggering outage. Since the count is consecutive, it is reset whenever a new webhook call comes through to the Watchdog.
- `deadman` (Boolean) When true, turns on a "Dead Man's Switch" for the Watchdog, according to the configuration set by `reporting_interval` and `consecutive_checks`. The Watchdog will trigger an "outage" state if the webhook does not receive a call after the configured number of consecutive checks (according to the reporting interval). This switch can be useful when a lack of webhook reporting from the specific component should be taken to mean that the component itself is down.,
- `reporting_interval` (Number) This property is only required when `deadman: true`. This property configures how often (in seconds) that you expect to POST status to the webhook.
- `webhook_key` (String, Sensitive) The key to use for this webhook, expected in request headers.
