# hund_issue (Resource)

The Issue resource represents an evolving incident in time. Issues have updates, which describe the evolution of an issue, often up to resolution. Issues may also set a schedule, which allows automatically starting and ending the issue.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "hund_issue" "example" {
  archive_on_destroy = true

  title         = "a terraform issue"
  body          = "detailed description of the issue"
  component_ids = ["5d72d51f8fbb65b5d3a587e1"]

  # Back-date an Issue
  # began_at = "2023-09-23T13:00:00Z"

  # Make this Issue scheduled
  schedule = {
    starts_at = timeadd("2023-09-23T13:00:00Z", "2h")
    ends_at   = timeadd("2023-09-23T13:00:00Z", "10h")
  }

  # Retrospectively create an Issue
  # updates = [
  #   {
  #     label = "resolved"
  #     body = "description of an already-resolved Issue"
  #   }
  # ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `component_ids` (Set of String) The Components IDs affected by this Issue.

### Optional

- `archive_on_destroy` (Boolean) When true, this Issue will not be destroyed from your status page if the resource is destroyed in your Terraform configuration. This option is **recommended** for maintaining a history on your status page of past Issues.
- `began_at` (String) The timestamp at which this Issue began affecting its given Components.
- `body` (String) The initial body text of the issue in raw markdown, in the default translation.
- `body_translations` (Map of String) The initial body text of the issue in raw markdown, translated into multiple languages. Map keys express the language each string value is to be interpreted in. The `original` field of this map denotes the language used for the non-`_translations` version of this attribute.
- `ended_at` (String) The UNIX timestamp at which this Issue stopped affecting its given Components. This field is `null` if it has not ended yet.
- `label` (String) The initial label applied to the issue. The "current" label of the entire issue may be updated by the labels of Issue Updates, though this must be taken from the latest Update in `updates`.
- `open_graph_image_url` (String) The URL to an image which will be displayed alongside this issue when shared on social media websites.
- `priority` (Number) The integer priority of the Issue. Priority pertains to how notifications are
triggered for this Issue: -1 indicates **low priority**, meaning no
notifications whatsoever will be triggered for this issue; 0 indicates
**normal priority**, which is the default behavior; and, 1 indicates
**high priority**, meaning all subscriptions across all notifiers will receive
notifications for this Issue regardless of their notification preferences.
- `schedule` (Attributes) An object detailing the Schedule of this issue if it is scheduled. This field is `null` if the Issue is not scheduled. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--schedule))
- `state_override` (Number) The integer state which overrides the state of affected Components in
`component`. A value of `null` indicates no override is present.
- `template` (Attributes) An application of an IssueTemplate, which contains a copy of the template fields of the associated IssueTemplate, as well as an object of user-defined variables that parameterize the template. 

-> Alterations to this field do not affect the associated `issue_template_id`, and will update the Issue/Update's content accordingly. Conversely, modification/deletion of the associated IssueTemplate do not affect the attributes of this field. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--template))
- `title` (String) The title of the Issue, in the default translation.
- `title_translations` (Map of String) The title of the Issue, translated into multiple languages. Map keys express the language each string value is to be interpreted in. The `original` field of this map denotes the language used for the non-`_translations` version of this attribute.
- `updates` (Attributes List) An optional list of Updates to create when initially creating the Issue. When creating a sequence of Updates, ensure that their `effective_after` timestamps do not encroach upon one another, or an error will occur.

~> This field is primarily meant for assisting with the creation of retrospective Issues, rather than creating new Updates as they arise. Please use the full hund_issue_update resource instead, rather than configuring this field directly. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--updates))

### Read-Only

- `body_html` (String) An HTML rendered view of the markdown in `body`, in the default translation.
- `body_html_translations` (Map of String) An HTML rendered view of the markdown in `body`, translated into multiple languages. Map keys express the language each string value is to be interpreted in. The `original` field of this map denotes the language used for the non-`_translations` version of this attribute.
- `cancelled_at` (String) The time at which this Issue was cancelled. This field is `null` if the Issue has not been cancelled or is not scheduled.
- `created_at` (String) The timestamp at which this Issue was created.
- `duration` (Number) The effective duration of this Issue in seconds. That is, the total amount of time for which this Issue affects its Components. Thus, this field only accumulates while the Issue is ongoing/open.

-> This value is zero for cancelled and informational Issues. For scheduled Issues, this field will remain zero until the Issue begins according to the Schedule.
- `id` (String) The ObjectId of this Issue.
- `resolved` (Boolean) Whether this Issue is currently resolved, thus no longer affecting its given
Components.
- `retrospective` (Boolean) Whether this Issue is retrospective; that is, the Issue was created both resolved
*and* backdated.
- `scheduled` (Boolean) Whether this Issue has a Schedule.
- `specialization` (String) Whether this Issue has special abilities or connotations. `general` is the default behavior, indicating no specialization. Other values include `maintenance`, which indicates an Issue shows affected components as "under maintenance," and `informational`, which indicates that the Issue is an informational bulletin.
- `standing` (Boolean) Whether this Issue is currently active and affecting its given Components.
- `updated_at` (String) The timestamp at which this Issue was last updated.

Optional:

- `notify_subscribers_at` (String) The time at which this scheduled Issue will fire a "heads-up" `issue_upcoming` notification, informing subscribers that the Issue will begin soon. This field is `null` if the Issue will not be sending an `issue_upcoming` notification.

-> This field cannot be changed once the Issue has emitted an `issue_upcoming` notification. Consider creating a new Update if you'd like to remind subscribers additional times apart from this automated notification.

Read-Only:

- `ended` (Boolean) Whether this scheduled Issue has ended.
- `id` (String) The ObjectId of this Schedule.
- `notified` (Boolean) Whether this scheduled Issue has fired an `issue_upcoming` notification.

### Nested Schema for `template`

Required:

- `issue_template_id` (String) The ObjectId of an IssueTemplate to use as the basis of this Application, which will inform the values for `body`, `label`, and `title` (when `kind = "issue"`). If this value is changed, then the application will be re-created according to the values of the given IssueTemplate.

Optional:
